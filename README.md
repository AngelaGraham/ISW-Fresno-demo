# ISW-Fresno-demo
Bootstrap 5 for demo update ideas
Worked on the demo. Here are the issues I still need to resolve. Non-exhuastive list
Many decisions need to be made as to put what where, but the ideas are here even though the site is less than perfect.

Carousel needs to have dark overlay so the text on the local houses of worship will be clearly visible.

Must decide on the spacing of the image/rows in the Event section
col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-12 ps-lg-5 mt-md-5    or    
col-lg-6 col-md-12 col-12 ps-lg-5 mt-md-5 for the images

The rows for educational partner images needs to be spaced better

THe speakers should have their own page with an icon for the CV and or links to their written works.

The contact page is just for show and does not go to an Air Table or Excel sheet or anything.
